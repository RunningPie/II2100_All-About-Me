Hi! I’m Dama D. Daliman a final‑year undergrad, part‑time backend wrangler, full‑time dreamer. Right now, I’m on a fast‑track program that lets me leapfrog straight into a master’s specialization in AI (because why walk when you can sprint into the future, right?).

My life is basically a balancing act between real intelligence (humans) and fake intelligence (machines), though honestly, sometimes the machines are easier to reason with. I’m also the big brother in a family of two kids, which means I’ve been debugging sibling conflicts long before I ever debugged code.

But this passion for making complex systems work together didn’t just appear overnight, unlike a certain Disney princess who woke up singing with birds 😉. I once dreamed of building “super AI” after watching an anime where it looked ridiculously cool. Two years into college, I was knee‑deep in data, swinging at insights like a kid with a piñata stick. Spoiler: most of the time, the candy didn’t fall.

Then came 2025: the year of hackathons. Chaotic, sleepless, caffeine‑fueled months where I learned more about building systems than any lecture hall could ever teach me. It was like running a marathon while juggling flaming torches: messy, exhausting, but unforgettable.

Now, with years of experience engineering data solutions and building backends, I’ve realized I’m not just a developer. I’m a problem‑solver who treats data like an old friend—sometimes annoying, sometimes cryptic, but always worth listening to. My goal isn’t just to write code, but to build systems that tell stories: clear, consistent, and reliable ones.

Outside the code editor, I wear a different hat: Vice Head of the Growth and Wellbeing Department in my student association. Basically, I help keep my peers sane while we all sprint toward deadlines. Think of me as the unofficial “patch update” for student morale.

And because I like to make life harder (and more exciting) for myself, I’m also learning Japanese. Why? Because my dream is to work abroad, and nothing says “I’m serious about this” like wrestling with kanji at 2 a.m.
So that’s me: a developer, a big brother, a student leader, and a future AI specialist who believes systems, whether human or machine, work best when they’re built with care, clarity, and maybe just a little bit of humor.
