Hi! I'm Dama D. Daliman, an undergrad student who's currently working on trying to make humans and AI get along, while also getting my feet wet into the world of backend development in blockchain with projects in cryptocurrency and Solana. My life is a constant exercise of managing real intelligence with "fake" intelligence.

But this passion for making complex systems work together wasn't something that grew overnight (unlike the story of a certain disney princess *wink*). I had originally wanted to make super AI, because I watched one anime where it had super AI in it and it seemed really cool to have something like that. 2 years into college, all I did was mingle with data 24/7, trying to whack insights here and there. But nothing seemed to work out well. That is, until 2025 came along. I went through a gauntlet of hackathons. It was chaotic, sleepless months, that taught me more about developing code than any single class in college could ever.

These past years of experience, from engineering data solutions to building backends, I've learned that I'm not just a developer. I'm a problem-solver who sees data as my buddy. My goal isn't just to write code, but to build systems that tell a clear, consistent, and reliable story.
