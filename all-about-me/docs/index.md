Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹
This static site is an autobiography made to introduce myself. But the introduction has it's own page you can check out later in the navbar on the left side.

For now, welcome to my home (that's why this landing page is called home). Enjoy the music and have some coffee.

    This static site webpage made using MkDocs is part of an assignment for the course II2100 - Interpersonal Communications at ITB.
