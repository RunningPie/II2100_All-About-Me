Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹
This static site is an autobiography made to introduce myself. But the introduction has it's own page you can check out later in the navbar on the left side.

For now, welcome to my home (that's why this landing page is called home). Have some coffee and enjoy the music. <span class="coffee-emoji" onclick="alert('Enjoy your coffee!')">â˜•</span>

<span style="color:#666; font-size:0.9em;">
  Click the coffee emoji to start the music.
</span>
