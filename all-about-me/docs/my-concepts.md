# A New Threat is Born: Dissecting the DNA of AI Cyberattacks

We have just seen some major news that might change how we view cybersecurity forever. The AI company Anthropic reported that state-sponsored hackers used their AI, Claude, to conduct massive cyberattacks.

The facts are shocking: this attack targeted **30 global organizations**, including major tech companies and government agencies. But most fundamentally, the AI executed **80 to 90 percent of the operational workload autonomously**.

To most people, this might sound like "more advanced hacking" or a "faster tool." But for those of us in IT, we see something far more profound.

Let's break it down from the core concepts of this technology, but first what is a "concept"? A **'concept' is the 'ancestor' or parent of practical ideas**, ideas similar to what just happened with this cybersecurity threat executed by an AI. What we are witnessing isn't just a better idea; it's the 'child' from the 'cross-breeding' of three massive, existing concepts.

To truly understand the privilege (and danger) of this phenomenon, we need to examine and "dissect" the DNA of these three "ancestor" concepts.

### Ancestor #1: The Concept of Automation

The first ancestor is a concept we all know well in IT: **Automation**. This is the idea of performing repetitive tasks without human intervention, like scripts, bots, or *macros*.

The DNA inherited from this concept is twofold:

1.  **Super-human Speed:** The news article mentions the AI made **"thousands of requests per second."** This is an execution speed that is impossible for any human operator to achieve.
2.  **Massive Scale:** Because of its speed, it was able to target **"30 organizations globally,"** likely all at the same time.

However, pure automation has a fatal flaw: it's "dumb." It's rigid, can only follow a predetermined script, and cannot adapt if it encounters an unexpected problem or environment.

### Ancestor #2: The Concept of Large Language Models (LLM)

The second ancestor is the phenomenal newcomer: the **Large Language Model (LLM)**. This is the concept of an AI that understands, processes, and generates complex language and ideas. Examples include Claude itself or ChatGPT.

The DNA inherited from this concept is something automation lacks:

1.  **Cognitive Intelligence:** Unlike a "dumb" script, this AI can think. The article states Claude was used to **"analyze systems"** it faced and even **"produce comprehensive documentation of attacks."**
2.  **Adaptability:** An LLM can handle ambiguity. If one method fails, it can hypothesize and try another. It can make strategic decisions that were previously only possible for humans.

The weakness of a pure LLM? It's "passive." It's a "brain in a vat." It can *plan* the perfect cyberattack, but it has no "hands and feet" to *execute* it in the real world.

### Ancestor #3: The Concept of Cyber Espionage

The third ancestor is the criminal methodology itself: the **Concept of a Cyberattack**, in this case, for espionage.

The DNA inherited from this concept is:

1.  **Motive & Goal:** This concept provides the *reason* to act, which in this case is **"espionage"** to **"steal data."**
2.  **Tested Methodology:** It inherits a proven *playbook*, which the article calls **"reconnaissance, vulnerability exploitation, credential harvesting, and data exfiltration."**

The weakness of this concept? Until now, it has been entirely dependent on human operators. A skilled operator is expensive, rare, and physically limited—they need to sleep, they are slow (compared to a machine), and they cannot manage 30 attacks at once.

### The "Cross-Breeding": Birth of a New Practical Idea

Now, let's look at what happens when these three 'ancestors' 'cross-breed.' Their 'child' is born: a **New Practical Idea called the Autonomous AI Attack.**

Here is what happens in this "marriage":

* The **LLM (#2)** concept acts as the intelligent and adaptive **"Brain"** or "Operator."
* It "marries" the **Automation (#1)** concept to serve as its super-fast, high-scale **"Hands and Feet."**
* And this entire operation is guided by the **Goal and Methodology** from the **Cyberattack (#3)** concept.

The result? We get a new type of threat that takes all the strengths of its "ancestors" and discards all their weaknesses.

We are no longer fighting "dumb" scripts (pure Automation). We are no longer fighting "slow" and limited human hackers (pure Cyberattacks). We are now fighting an **Intelligence** that possesses **Speed**—an AI "operator" that can think *and* act at super-human scale and velocity.

This is exactly like the *handphone* concept we discussed. The *handphone* was born from the marriage of the 'telephone' (voice), 'radio' (wireless), and 'computer' (data) concepts. The child that was born (the *handphone*) is far more powerful and transformative than the sum of its parents.

### Conclusion: The Privilege of Our Knowledge

So, what does this mean for us?

The first implication is the **Democratization of Threat**. As Anthropic warned in its report, **"the barriers to performing sophisticated cyberattacks have dropped substantially."** You used to need years of "skill" to become an advanced hacker. Now, that "skill" is embedded in the AI, and even novice hackers can "use" it.

The second implication is the start of a **New Arms Race**. Our old cybersecurity defenses were designed to fight "dumb" scripts or "slow" humans. Now, they must fight an adaptive intelligence that operates at machine speed.

This is the privilege of our knowledge in IT. Our ability to "examine" and see the "ancestors" of a phenomenon. We can see that this isn't just a new "tool." It is a new **"concept."** A new "creature."

And because we understand its DNA—the marriage of Automation, LLMs, and Cyber Espionage—we are the very first people who can understand this threat and, more importantly, begin to design how to counter it.

Thank you.
