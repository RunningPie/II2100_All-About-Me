# Lessons Learned

This section curates the knowledge gained during literature research of conceptualizing the idea for AI-Powered Public Health Vending Machine, focusing on the lessons learned about system failure, ethics, and the holistic nature of engineering.

## The Fallacy of "Tech-First" and the Importance of the "Heart"
One of the most critical lessons I have learned is that technical superiority does not guarantee success. The case study of [HealthSpot](https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2020/11/20/healthspot-bankruptcy-winding-down.html), a kiosk company that went bankrupt despite having advanced technology, teaches us that the "Energy" (economic viability) and "Heart" (user experience) are just as important as the "Mind" (AI). HealthSpot failed because it was too expensive (high OPEX) and created workflow friction—it was an island, unconnected to the patient's medical home.

**Knowledge Curated**: Successful innovation requires "interoperability" not just of code, but of workflows. The kiosk must integrate with existing hospital systems (via platforms like TEngage) so that the data "flows" to the patient's primary care doctor.

**Lesson**: We must avoid "solutionism." Technology should not be deployed at a community but with it. The research on ["Participatory Design"](https://www.researchprotocols.org/2025/1/e64913) shows that involving local community health workers (CHWs) to champion the kiosks is essential for building the trust required for adoption. Without the "Heart," the "Mind" is useless.

## From Vending to Collective Intelligence: A New Paradigm
I have learned that these machines are not merely dispensing units; they are sensors for the planet. By aggregating anonymized symptom data (e.g., a spike in fever medications sold in a specific zip code), these kiosks can function as a real-time Disease Surveillance System.

**Knowledge Curated**: This represents a shift to Collective Intelligence. The network of kiosks acts as a "nervous system" for public health, detecting outbreaks faster than traditional hospital reporting.

**Lesson**: The ultimate "Mahakarya" (Masterpiece) is the harmonization of the system. It is about aligning the Physics (solar power, supply chain), the Logic (AI accuracy, triage algorithms), and the Ethics (privacy, equity) into a unified whole. As an IST student, my knowledge base has expanded from "how to build it" to "how to sustain it," realizing that the true engineering challenge lies in the complex interplay between the machine and the human spirit.
