# MY SHAPES

I’ve always been driven by a deep curiosity and a love for understanding how things work. Today, I see myself as a passionate learner whose analytical mind thrives on complexity—but not for complexity’s sake. I’m drawn to problems that demand both systems thinking and creativity, and I approach them with humility, knowing that the most elegant solutions often emerge from listening, iterating, and staying open to what I don’t yet know.

I’ve come to see my approach to problem-solving much like my hobby in photography. My analytical mind is like a macro lens, allowing me to zoom in and understand the intricate, critical details of a challenge. But I know that true understanding requires more than just a close-up. That's why I value systems thinking—it's like switching to a wide-angle lens to see the entire composition, understanding how every element connects and influences the whole. I’m driven by a love for learning how to use both perspectives, approaching problems with the creativity of a photographer and the humility of knowing that the most elegant solution is the one that captures the complete picture.

This perspective didn’t come overnight. Early in my journey, I immersed myself in data competitions, convinced that technical precision alone would chart my path forward. I vividly remember a competition called "Data Slayers" where my team was classifying vehicle types. My approach was generic, running through standard data cleaning techniques. Meanwhile, a teammate who carried our team to success was digging deeper, using domain knowledge to engineer features—like how engine size correlates with fuel consumption for specific car models. It was a humbling moment. I realized that focusing too narrowly on models risked blinding me to the context that gives data meaning. That shift—learning to widen my lens from the 'how' to the 'why'—was transformative. As an INTJ, I naturally lean into logic and structure, but my most important growth has come from embracing the limits of my own knowledge. The proverb “above the sky, there is still a sky” resonates deeply with me: it reminds me that no matter how much I learn, there’s always more beyond my horizon. That awareness has grounded me in humility and taught me to lead with empathy rather than judgment.

Looking ahead, I’m eager to bring this balanced mindset into a professional environment that values integrity, ethical reasoning, and collaborative innovation. I believe my ability to think abstractly, connect ideas across domains, and learn continuously—paired with a genuine commitment to understanding people—will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team. More than just solving problems, I want to help shape solutions that are thoughtful, inclusive, and enduring.
