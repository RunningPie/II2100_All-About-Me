# MY SHAPES

I’ve always been driven by a deep curiosity and a love for understanding how things work. Today, I see myself as a passionate learner whose analytical mind thrives on complexity—but not for complexity’s sake. I’m drawn to problems that demand both systems thinking and creativity, and I approach them with humility, knowing that the most elegant solutions often emerge from listening, iterating, and staying open to what I don’t yet know.

This perspective didn’t come overnight. Early in my journey, I immersed myself in data competitions, convinced that technical precision alone would chart my path forward. But over time, I realized that focusing too narrowly on metrics and models risked blinding me to the human dimensions of the challenges I wanted to solve. That shift—learning to widen my lens—was transformative. As an INTJ, I naturally lean into logic and structure, but my most important growth has come from embracing the limits of my own knowledge. The Chinese proverb “above the sky, there is still a sky” resonates deeply with me: it reminds me that no matter how much I learn, there’s always more beyond my horizon. That awareness has grounded me in humility and taught me to lead with empathy rather than judgment.

Looking ahead, I’m eager to bring this balanced mindset into a professional environment that values integrity, ethical reasoning, and collaborative innovation. I believe my ability to think abstractly, connect ideas across domains, and learn continuously—paired with a genuine commitment to understanding people—will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team. More than just solving problems, I want to help shape solutions that are thoughtful, inclusive, and enduring.
