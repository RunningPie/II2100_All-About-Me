I wrote this song to reminisce my recent memory of a certain friend. Every part of the lyrics depicted some shared memory between us.

### <strong> === Lyrics === </strong>

(Intro)</br>
Do you recall that hackathon glow?</br>
Projects on screens, crowds moving slow</br>
Then you turned—smiling like sunrise—</br>
Lit up the room with your bright eyes.</br>

All in blue, with tea in hand,</br>
Talking ‘bout Soul and the Great Beyond</br>
How Joe found purpose, note by note…</br>
I wished my spark was you to hold.</br>

(Bridge)</br>
Now I stare at this empty sky,</br>
Can’t unsee our last “goodbye.”</br>
I boarded my flight, you waved below—</br>
The world went quiet… without your glow.</br>

(Chorus)</br>
u-u-u…</br>
Without you-u-u-u…</br>
This blue I knew</br>
Is just… without you.</br>

(Verse 2)</br>
Back in my city, streets feel gray,</br>
Play “Parting Ways” most every day.</br>
That photobooth strip—you laughing, me—</br>
Stuck on my mirror, haunting me.</br>

We chased red beams in laser tag dark,</br>
Your smile still left its afterglow spark</br>
Now I brew your tea (black, no sugar, right?),</br>
And hope your soul feels… just as bright.</br>

(Chorus) </br>
Now I stare at this empty sky,</br>
Can’t unsee your wave “goodbye.”</br>
You stayed behind in that bright hall—</br>
Left me aching… missing all.</br>

(Outro)</br>
Without you…</br>
Your laugh, your Soul, your blue, your grace,</br>
My world’s just…</br>
So blue.</br>
...Just blue.</br>

### Meanings
The first and second paragraph introduces the plot of this story, it all started at a hackathon event. Meeting her, seeing her smile and wearing all blue, burned into memory.

Shared quite some stories, she talked about how she liked disney, and the movie Soul.

The bridge and chorus reminisce the moments of goodbye, marking the end of this chapter of memory.

The second verse depicts the longing for those shared moments, back here, after snapping out of that experience that felt like a fever dream.

Some of the memories never truly fade, the photobooth photo strip, playful moments in laser tag. Right now, trying to relive all of that again, "trying to brew her tea", hoping she feels the same.

## Why'd That Chicken Cross The Road?

Remember the old riddle "Why did the chicken cross the road?", well you might just find the answer in this song

### <strong> === Lyrics === </strong>
(Verse 1)
Farmer Joe had a hen,
She ran off again!
Flapped right over the gate,
Now Joe’s just talkin’ to fate.
...
(Chorus)
Why’d that chicken cross the road?
Why’d that chicken cross the road?
The mailman tipped his hat and said,
“Farmer Joe, where’s she been led?”
...
(Verse 2)
Joe said, “Chasin’ a bee!”
Mailman smirked, “Nah, not to me.”
“Maybe meetin’ ol’ Rooster Clive?”
Mailman chuckled, “She’s too alive!”
...
(Verse 3)
“She’s startin’ a yoga class!”
“Or takin’ a car that passed!”
Mailman laughed, “You’re losin’ hope.”
Joe said, “She’s allergic to my soap!”
...
(Chorus)
Why’d that chicken cross the road?
Why’d that chicken cross the road?
The mailman tipped his hat and said,
“Farmer Joe, she’s in your head.”
...
(Verse 4)
“She’s learnin’ to dance!
She’s joinin’ a band!
Maybe she’s scoutin’
A better land!”
Mailman just grinned,
Gave a wink and a nod—
Left Joe there mumblin’,
Kickin’ at the sod.
...
Then one bright mornin',
Same ol’ hen, reborn
Crossed the lane with pride,
Feathers all adorned.
...
Mailman stopped the truck,
Said, “Well I’ll be”
Joe leaned in close,
“What d’ya see?”
...
Mailman sighed,
Shook his head with a groan
He whispered, real soft
like the world had known
...
"I dunno"
.
.
.
Why’d that chicken cross the road?
Nobody knows

### Meanings
At its heart, "Why’d That Chicken Cross the Road?" isn’t really about a hen—or a farmer—or even a mailman.

**It’s about the human need to find meaning in mystery.**

Farmer Joe represents all of us: endlessly searching for reasons, crafting elaborate theories, desperate to understand why things happen—especially when they’re out of our control. He blames bees, roosters, yoga, soap allergies… anything to make sense of the inexplicable.

The mailman? He’s life itself: calm, amused, and ultimately silent. He never gives an answer—not because he’s cruel, but because **some questions don’t have answers. And that’s okay.**

When he finally says, “I dunno,” it’s not a failure—it’s freedom.

The chicken crosses the road not for a reason we can name, but simply because she chooses to. She follows her own path, feathers adorned, pride intact—unbothered by logic, expectation, or Farmer Joe’s theories.

In the end, the song whispers a quiet truth:

>Not everything needs a reason to be meaningful. Sometimes, the act of crossing is the purpose.

**So go ahead—cross your own road.
You don’t need a reason.
You just need to flap your wings… and go.**
