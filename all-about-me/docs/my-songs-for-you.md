I wrote this song to reminisce my recent memory of a certain friend. Every part of the lyrics depicted some shared memory between us.

### <strong> === Lyrics === </strong>

(Intro)</br>
Do you recall that hackathon glow?</br>
Projects on screens, crowds moving slow</br>
Then you turned—smiling like sunrise—</br>
Lit up the room with your bright eyes.</br>

All in blue, with tea in hand,</br>
Talking ‘bout Soul and the Great Beyond</br>
How Joe found purpose, note by note…</br>
I wished my spark was you to hold.</br>

(Bridge)</br>
Now I stare at this empty sky,</br>
Can’t unsee our last “goodbye.”</br>
I boarded my flight, you waved below—</br>
The world went quiet… without your glow.</br>

(Chorus)</br>
u-u-u…</br>
Without you-u-u-u…</br>
This blue I knew</br>
Is just… without you.</br>

(Verse 2)</br>
Back in my city, streets feel gray,</br>
Play “Parting Ways” most every day.</br>
That photobooth strip—you laughing, me—</br>
Stuck on my mirror, haunting me.</br>

We chased red beams in laser tag dark,</br>
Your smile still left its afterglow spark</br>
Now I brew your tea (black, no sugar, right?),</br>
And hope your soul feels… just as bright.</br>

(Chorus) </br>
Now I stare at this empty sky,</br>
Can’t unsee your wave “goodbye.”</br>
You stayed behind in that bright hall—</br>
Left me aching… missing all.</br>

(Outro)</br>
Without you…</br>
Your laugh, your Soul, your blue, your grace,</br>
My world’s just…</br>
So blue.</br>
...Just blue.</br>

### Meanings
The first and second paragraph introduces the plot of this story, it all started at a hackathon event. Meeting her, seeing her smile and wearing all blue, burned into memory.

Shared quite some stories, she talked about how she liked disney, and the movie Soul.

The bridge and chorus reminisce the moments of goodbye, marking the end of this chapter of memory.

The second verse depicts the longing for those shared moments, back here, after snapping out of that experience that felt like a fever dream.

Some of the memories never truly fade, the photobooth photo strip, playful moments in laser tag. Right now, trying to relive all of that again, "trying to brew her tea", hoping she feels the same.
