### Act I: The Dream in the Clouds
I can still remember the feeling vividly. After a string of failures in various data competitions, the ticket to the Google Solution Challenge finals in Manila felt like redemption. On the plane, my mind was filled with heroic daydreams. "Is this the moment?" I thought. "To carry the name of my nation and my university onto the international stage." I pictured the flag being raised, a victory that would silence all doubt.

Although, as you'll soon read, it didn't quite turn out that way.

My initial goal was simple: to try a new arena as an AI Engineer and get my hands dirty with RAG chatbot technology. I wasn't expecting much; just making it to the finals was an immense source of pride. But that euphoria quietly began to build a much greater hope.

### Act II: A Shallow Encounter, A Profound Lesson
The final venue in Manila was buzzing with energy. Amidst hundreds of innovators from around the world, my team and I found our attention drawn to one of the team from Korea. I have to admit, the reason was quite funny. My very extroverted friend was determined to introduce himself to one of the female members of their team. That’s how our interaction began, including with one of their team members, let's just call her "J."

At first, my interest in J was similarly superficial—I was charmed by the "Korean charm" we often see in the media. But the more we shared our stories, my admiration transformed. It was no longer about her nationality, but about who she was as a developer and an innovator.

Funnily enough, when I first saw their project presentation, my initial thought was, "Oh, is that it?" Their project didn't seem technically complex. But one thing stood out: they were far more prepared. They had brought flyers, posters, and even a standing banner all the way from their country. We, on the other hand, were still busy perfecting our code.

The turning point for me was when J shared her philosophy. As an IT developer, she wasn't obsessed with AI at all. "In big 'ol 2025? She's gotta be insane!", I thought. "My team and I actively look for real-world problems around us," she said. "I prefer frontend development because it encourages me to empathize with the user." That last sentence—"it encourages me to empathize"—hit me hard.

### Act III: A Contrast Revealed in Hindsight
On the night before the final exhibition, that contrast became starkly clear, though I only fully recognize it now. My team was stuck in a heated debate: should we add a computer vision feature overnight? It was a feature that was very "AI-centric," sophisticated, but honestly, irrelevant to the core problem we were trying to solve. Our focus was on technical flashiness.

Meanwhile, J's words about empathy echoed in my mind. Her team's solution was deeply social-oriented, focused on people, not on the complexity of their code.

The moment of truth arrived, the awarding ceremony. Our team's name wasn't called. A pang of sadness crept in; the dream of raising my flag on that stage had to be buried. Then, J's team was announced as the winner of the "Most Social Impact" category. Strangely, my sadness was immediately replaced by a sense of understanding. I saw them on stage and thought, "Truly, their solution was the most deserving."

### Act IV: Envy as Fuel
That defeat didn't feel like a defeat. I came home not with a trophy, but with a new perspective. The definition of "extraordinary work" in my mind had completely changed. It was no longer about complex algorithms or the latest technology, but about solutions that were truly human-oriented.

I also realized that to build empathetic solutions, my technical foundation had to be solid. I couldn't truly help users if I wasn't a reliable developer myself.

That encounter in Manila became a turning point. I began to map out my life goals anew, determined to master a field with a high degree of specific skill. The biggest decision born from that inspiration was to finally solidfy my plan for a Master's degree in Informatics, the path I am on today.

To this day, I still follow J and her team's journey on social media. Every time I see their achievements, I’ll be honest—there's a little bit of envy. But it's no longer a toxic feeling. Instead, it has become the best kind of fuel, a constant reminder to keep chasing my own dreams, with a newfound definition of success.
