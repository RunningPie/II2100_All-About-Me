Daliman</p> <p>Published: September 18, 2025</p> <p>Hi! I\u2019m Dama D. Daliman a final\u2011year undergrad, part\u2011time backend wrangler, full\u2011time dreamer. Right now, I\u2019m on a fast\u2011track program that lets me leapfrog straight into a master\u2019s specialization in AI (because why walk when you can sprint into the future, right?).</p> <p></p> <p>My life is basically a balancing act between real intelligence (humans) and fake intelligence (machines), though honestly, sometimes the machines are easier to reason with. I\u2019m also the big brother in a family of two kids, which means I\u2019ve been debugging sibling conflicts long before I ever debugged code.</p> <p>But this passion for making complex systems work together didn\u2019t just appear overnight, unlike a certain Disney princess who woke up singing with birds \ud83d\ude09. I once dreamed of building \u201csuper AI\u201d after watching an anime where it looked ridiculously cool. Two years into college, I was knee\u2011deep in data, swinging at insights like a kid with a pi\u00f1ata stick. Spoiler: most of the time, the candy didn\u2019t fall.</p> <p>Then came 2025: the year of hackathons. Chaotic, sleepless, caffeine\u2011fueled months where I learned more about building systems than any lecture hall could ever teach me. It was like running a marathon while juggling flaming torches: messy, exhausting, but unforgettable.</p> <p>Now, with years of experience engineering data solutions and building backends, I\u2019ve realized I\u2019m not just a developer. I\u2019m a problem\u2011solver who treats data like an old friend\u2014sometimes annoying, sometimes cryptic, but always worth listening to. My goal isn\u2019t just to write code, but to build systems that tell stories: clear, consistent, and reliable ones.</p> <p>Outside the code editor, I wear a different hat: Vice Head of the Growth and Wellbeing Department in my student association. Basically, I help keep my peers sane while we all sprint toward deadlines. Think of me as the unofficial \u201cpatch update\u201d for student morale.</p> <p>And because I like to make life harder (and more exciting) for myself, I\u2019m also learning Japanese. Why? Because my dream is to work abroad, and nothing says \u201cI\u2019m serious about this\u201d like wrestling with kanji at 2 a.m. So that\u2019s me: a developer, a big brother, a student leader, and a future AI specialist who believes systems, whether human or machine, work best when they\u2019re built with care, clarity, and maybe just a little bit of humor.</p>"},{"location":"my-concepts/","title":"The Crisis of Coordination in Public Health","text":""},{"location":"my-concepts/#the-anatomy-of-care-deserts-and-the-last-mile-problem","title":"The anatomy of \"Care Deserts\" and the Last Mile Problem","text":"<p>The fundamental phenomenon addressing the inaccessibility of basic medical services is best understood through the concept of \"Care Deserts.\" These are geographic or socioeconomic zones where the population lacks adequate access to essential health services, creating a profound \"Last Mile\" problem in public health delivery. While modern medicine has achieved expert-level diagnostic capabilities, these advancements remain centralized in urban hubs, effectively decoupling \"capacity\" from \"delivery.\" Current data indicates that rural populations experience significantly higher mortality rates from treatable conditions compared to urban populations, primarily due to the logistical friction of accessing care. This is not simply a lack of doctors; it is a spatial mismatch between where expertise resides and where humanity lives. \u00a0 </p> <p>The phenomenon is exacerbated by the \"Digital Divide,\" which renders traditional home-based telemedicine ineffective for the most vulnerable. A significant percentage of rural residents lack the high-speed broadband required for video consultations, meaning the \"digital front door\" to healthcare is locked for millions. Consequently, the current system relies on a high-friction, brick-and-mortar model that forces patients to travel long distances for minor ailments. This inefficiency leads to delayed treatment, where manageable minor illnesses escalate into critical emergencies, overburdening the tertiary care system. The concept here is clear: the current infrastructure is an \"analog\" solution trying to serve a digital-speed world, resulting in a systemic failure to coordinate care for the 8 billion people on the planet.</p>"},{"location":"my-concepts/#the-triune-intelligence-system-engineering-tise-disconnect","title":"The Triune Intelligence System Engineering (TISE) Disconnect","text":"<p>From a systems engineering perspective, the phenomenon of inaccessibility can be analyzed using the Triune Intelligence System Engineering (TISE) framework. TISE posits that a functional system must harmonize three layers: The Mind (Homodeus/Artificial Intelligence), The Heart (Homocordium/Human Values), and The Energy (Natural Intelligence/Physics). The current crisis represents a fracture in this triad. We have developed \"The Mind\" (advanced medical knowledge and diagnostic AI), but we lack the distributed \"Energy\" (physical infrastructure and logistics) to deliver it, and we often fail \"The Heart\" by ignoring the cultural and emotional needs of underserved communities. \u00a0 </p> <p>The prevailing model of healthcare delivery fails to utilize the \"Synergistic Practical Intelligence\" (PI-A) available through modern technology. Instead of leveraging automation to handle routine \"lower-order\" tasks (like triage and dispensing basic meds), we continue to rely on \"Human Energon\" (doctors and nurses) for every interaction. This misallocation of human intelligence creates bottlenecks. The concept of \"accessibility\" therefore needs to be redefined: it is not just about building more hospitals (which is economically unfeasible), but about creating a \"Mahakarya Rekayasa\" (Masterpiece of Engineering) that decentralizes care, moving the locus of health from the institution to the community through autonomous, intelligent nodes.</p>"},{"location":"my-innovations/","title":"The AI-Powered Public Health Vending Machine","text":""},{"location":"my-innovations/#system-architecture-the-pudal-control-cycle","title":"System Architecture: The PUDAL Control Cycle","text":"<p>The core innovation is an AI-Powered Public Health Vending Machine designed to execute the PUDAL (Perception, Understanding, Decision, Action, Learning) cycle autonomously.

Crucially, it integrates Computer Vision using depth sensors (AutoDepth) to analyze minor injuries. This allows the machine to \"see\" a wound, calculate its dimensions, and characterize tissue type (e.g., granulation vs. slough) without human intervention.</p> <p>Understanding &amp; Decision (The AI Mind): The \"brain\" of the system utilizes a GAMENet (Graph Augmented Memory Networks) architecture. This advanced NLP model processes the patient\u2019s self-reported symptoms and vital signs, cross-referencing them with anonymized electronic health records (EHR) and drug interaction databases. The innovation here is the system\u2019s ability to triage: it distinguishes between a minor ailment (treatable on-site) and an emergency (requiring immediate referral), acting as a safe, automated gatekeeper.</p> <p>Action (Robotic Dispensing): Unlike telemedicine apps, this machine performs a physical action.

My stance is that we must utilize IT to act as the \"Juru Tulis Cerdas\" (Smart Scribe/Instrument) described in the TISE philosophy. We possess the \"Homodeus\" capabilities: the algorithms, the data processing power, and the connectivity, but we have a moral obligation to direct these powers toward \"Homocordium\" (human-centric) goals. Facing the condition of health inaccessibility, inaction is a failure of our discipline.</p> <p>I argue that the standard approach of \"more apps\" is insufficient. An app cannot dispense antibiotics to a patient with an infection, nor can it physically measure blood pressure for a user without a device. Therefore, my opinion is that IST students must embrace \"Cyber-Physical Systems\" solutions that bleed out of the screen and into the physical world. We must design systems that are not just \"smart\" but \"tangible.\" The action I advocate for is the development of autonomous physical interfaces, maybe kiosks or vending machines, that serve as the bridge between the digital cloud of medical knowledge and the physical reality of a patient\u2019s needs.

Instead, my opinion is that we must design for Hybrid Collective Intelligence. We should view the AI not as an oracle, but as a high-precision filter that augments the human care network. In the face of the provider shortage crisis, it is illogical to demand that a human physician handle every case of the common cold. My stance is that we must delegate these routine PUDAL (Perception, Understanding, Decision, Action, Learning) cycles to machines to preserve the \"Human Energon\" for complex, high-empathy cases.</p> <p>Furthermore, I argue that trust is the currency of this transaction. A purely algorithmic system will be rejected by the \"Heart\" of the community if it feels cold or alien. Therefore, my action plan involves advocating for \"Participatory Design,\" where the technology is co-created with the communities it serves. We must treat the user not as a passive recipient of data, but as a \"Protagonist-Author\" in their own health narrative. By integrating local cultural norms and human-in-the-loop escalation protocols, we can build a system that is technically robust (\"Logic\") and socially embraced (\"Heart\").</p>"},{"location":"my-personal-reviews/","title":"Assessment Report for UTS-1 through UTS-4","text":""},{"location":"my-personal-reviews/#identification","title":"Identification","text":"<ul> <li>Student Name: Dama</li> <li>Student ID: 18222047</li> <li>Evaluator: Dama</li> </ul>"},{"location":"my-personal-reviews/#general-review","title":"General Review","text":"<p>The overall submission demonstrates a clear structure and logical organization across all tasks.

Today, I see myself as a passionate learner whose analytical mind thrives on complexity\u2014but not for complexity\u2019s sake. I\u2019m drawn to problems that demand both systems thinking and creativity, and I approach them with humility, knowing that the most elegant solutions often emerge from listening, iterating, and staying open to what I don\u2019t yet know.</p> <p>I\u2019ve come to see my approach to problem-solving much like my hobby in photography. My analytical mind is like a macro lens, allowing me to zoom in and understand the intricate, critical details of a challenge. But I know that true understanding requires more than just a close-up. That's why I value systems thinking\u2014it's like switching to a wide-angle lens to see the entire composition, understanding how every element connects and influences the whole. I\u2019m driven by a love for learning how to use both perspectives, approaching problems with the creativity of a photographer and the humility of knowing that the most elegant solution is the one that captures the complete picture.</p> <p></p> <p>This perspective didn\u2019t come overnight. Early in my journey, I immersed myself in data competitions, convinced that technical precision alone would chart my path forward. I vividly remember a competition called \"Data Slayers\" where my team was classifying vehicle types. My approach was generic, running through standard data cleaning techniques. Meanwhile, a teammate who carried our team to success was digging deeper, using domain knowledge to engineer features\u2014like how engine size correlates with fuel consumption for specific car models. It was a humbling moment. I realized that focusing too narrowly on models risked blinding me to the context that gives data meaning. That shift\u2014learning to widen my lens from the 'how' to the 'why'\u2014was transformative. As an INTJ, I naturally lean into logic and structure, but my most important growth has come from embracing the limits of my own knowledge. The proverb \u201cabove the sky, there is still a sky\u201d resonates deeply with me: it reminds me that no matter how much I learn, there\u2019s always more beyond my horizon. That awareness has grounded me in humility and taught me to lead with empathy rather than judgment.</p> <p>Looking ahead, I\u2019m eager to bring this balanced mindset into a professional environment that values integrity, ethical reasoning, and collaborative innovation. I believe my ability to think abstractly, connect ideas across domains, and learn continuously\u2014paired with a genuine commitment to understanding people\u2014will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team. More than just solving problems, I want to help shape solutions that are thoughtful, inclusive, and enduring.</p>"},{"location":"my-shapes/#self-charter","title":"Self-Charter","text":"<p>Life Mission: To design and build ethical, systems-driven solutions that solve complex problems and foster peace, driven by a humble and continuous love of learning.</p> <p>Core Values: Ethics, Peace, Humility, Integrity, Financial Stability.</p> <p>Core Roles:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Systems-Thinker &amp; Problem-Solver: Leveraging abstract thinking and analytical reasoning to deconstruct complex challenges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creative &amp; Ethical Innovator: Applying creativity and cross-domain knowledge to build novel solutions with unwavering integrity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Empathetic Collaborator: Using empathy and collaborative intelligence to work effectively within a team and understand user needs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Decision Compass:</p> <ul> <li>Ethical Alignment: Does this align with my core values of ethics and integrity?</li> <li>Potential for Learning: Does this offer an opportunity to learn and grow, acknowledging there is always more to know?</li> <li>Making the Choice Right: Is this a path where I can commit to making my choice right, rather than searching for a perfect choice?</li> <li>Collaborative Peace: Does this foster a peaceful and collaborative environment?</li> </ul> <p>Service Promise: To approach challenges with humility , listen with empathy , offer well-reasoned analytical solutions , and innovate with creativity and integrity.</p> <p>Boundaries: Saying no to projects that compromise ethical principles.

No, it was the far more humble, almost clinical scent of industrial-strength air conditioning. That sterile aroma, a smell that promised both focus and anxiety, mingled with the constant, fascinating hum of a dozen different languages swirling together. It was a veritable Tower of Babel, but for code. Ten teams, different nations, all speaking the universal dialects of Python and JavaScript, yet all whispering their own unique hopes.</p> <p>Floating in that sea of ambition, I allowed myself to indulge in a heroic fantasy: I would be the one to carry the name of my nation, my university, onto that global stage.

It just felt\u2026 right.</p> <p>But the true lesson, the real trophy, wasn't handed out on that stage. It arrived quietly, a week later, in a WhatsApp message from J.

I learned that the shiniest tool in the box is just dead weight if you don't first understand the human heart it's meant to serve.
