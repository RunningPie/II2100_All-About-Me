Daliman</p> <p>Published: September 18, 2025</p> <p>Hi! I'm Dama D. Daliman, an undergrad student who's currently working on trying to make humans and AI get along, while also getting my feet wet into the world of backend development in blockchain with projects in cryptocurrency and Solana. My life is a constant exercise of managing real intelligence with \"fake\" intelligence.</p> <p>But this passion for making complex systems work together wasn't something that grew overnight (unlike the story of a certain disney princess wink). I had originally wanted to make super AI, because I watched one anime where it had super AI in it and it seemed really cool to have something like that. 2 years into college, all I did was mingle with data 24/7, trying to whack insights here and there. But nothing seemed to work out well. That is, until 2025 came along. I went through a gauntlet of hackathons. It was chaotic, sleepless months, that taught me more about developing code than any single class in college could ever.</p> <p>These past years of experience, from engineering data solutions to building backends, I've learned that I'm not just a developer. I'm a problem-solver who sees data as my buddy. My goal isn't just to write code, but to build systems that tell a clear, consistent, and reliable story.</p>"},{"location":"my-shapes/","title":"MY SHAPES","text":"<p>I\u2019ve always been driven by a deep curiosity and a love for understanding how things work. Today, I see myself as a passionate learner whose analytical mind thrives on complexity\u2014but not for complexity\u2019s sake. I\u2019m drawn to problems that demand both systems thinking and creativity, and I approach them with humility, knowing that the most elegant solutions often emerge from listening, iterating, and staying open to what I don\u2019t yet know.</p> <p></p> <p>This perspective didn\u2019t come overnight. Early in my journey, I immersed myself in data competitions, convinced that technical precision alone would chart my path forward. But over time, I realized that focusing too narrowly on metrics and models risked blinding me to the human dimensions of the challenges I wanted to solve. That shift\u2014learning to widen my lens\u2014was transformative. As an INTJ, I naturally lean into logic and structure, but my most important growth has come from embracing the limits of my own knowledge. The Chinese proverb \u201cabove the sky, there is still a sky\u201d resonates deeply with me: it reminds me that no matter how much I learn, there\u2019s always more beyond my horizon. That awareness has grounded me in humility and taught me to lead with empathy rather than judgment.</p> <p>Looking ahead, I\u2019m eager to bring this balanced mindset into a professional environment that values integrity, ethical reasoning, and collaborative innovation. I believe my ability to think abstractly, connect ideas across domains, and learn continuously\u2014paired with a genuine commitment to understanding people\u2014will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team. More than just solving problems, I want to help shape solutions that are thoughtful, inclusive, and enduring.</p>"},{"location":"my-shapes/#self-charter","title":"Self-Charter","text":"<p>Life Mission: To design and build ethical, systems-driven solutions that solve complex problems and foster peace, driven by a humble and continuous love of learning.</p> <p>Core Values: Ethics, Peace, Humility, Integrity, Financial Stability.</p> <p>Core Roles:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Systems-Thinker &amp; Problem-Solver: Leveraging abstract thinking and analytical reasoning to deconstruct complex challenges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creative &amp; Ethical Innovator: Applying creativity and cross-domain knowledge to build novel solutions with unwavering integrity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Empathetic Collaborator: Using empathy and collaborative intelligence to work effectively within a team and understand user needs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Decision Compass:</p> <ul> <li>Ethical Alignment: Does this align with my core values of ethics and integrity?</li> <li>Potential for Learning: Does this offer an opportunity to learn and grow, acknowledging there is always more to know?</li> <li>Making the Choice Right: Is this a path where I can commit to making my choice right, rather than searching for a perfect choice?</li> <li>Collaborative Peace: Does this foster a peaceful and collaborative environment?</li> </ul> <p>Service Promise: To approach challenges with humility , listen with empathy , offer well-reasoned analytical solutions , and innovate with creativity and integrity.</p> <p>Boundaries: Saying no to projects that compromise ethical principles.

Amidst hundreds of innovators from around the world, my team and I found our attention drawn to one of the team from Korea. I have to admit, the reason was quite funny. My very extroverted friend was determined to introduce himself to one of the female members of their team. That\u2019s how our interaction began, including with one of their team members, let's just call her \"J.\"</p> <p>At first, my interest in J was similarly superficial\u2014I was charmed by the \"Korean charm\" we often see in the media. But the more we shared our stories, my admiration transformed. It was no longer about her nationality, but about who she was as a developer and an innovator.</p> <p>Funnily enough, when I first saw their project presentation, my initial thought was, \"Oh, is that it?\" Their project didn't seem technically complex. But one thing stood out: they were far more prepared. They had brought flyers, posters, and even a standing banner all the way from their country. We, on the other hand, were still busy perfecting our code.</p> <p>The turning point for me was when J shared her philosophy. As an IT developer, she wasn't obsessed with AI at all. \"In big 'ol 2025? She's gotta be insane!\", I thought. \"My team and I actively look for real-world problems around us,\" she said. \"I prefer frontend development because it encourages me to empathize with the user.\" That last sentence\u2014\"it encourages me to empathize\"\u2014hit me hard.</p>"},{"location":"my-stories-for-you/#act-iii-a-contrast-revealed-in-hindsight","title":"Act III: A Contrast Revealed in Hindsight","text":"<p>On the night before the final exhibition, that contrast became starkly clear, though I only fully recognize it now. My team was stuck in a heated debate: should we add a computer vision feature overnight? It was a feature that was very \"AI-centric,\" sophisticated, but honestly, irrelevant to the core problem we were trying to solve. Our focus was on technical flashiness.</p> <p>Meanwhile, J's words about empathy echoed in my mind. Her team's solution was deeply social-oriented, focused on people, not on the complexity of their code.</p> <p>The moment of truth arrived, the awarding ceremony. Our team's name wasn't called. A pang of sadness crept in; the dream of raising my flag on that stage had to be buried. Then, J's team was announced as the winner of the \"Most Social Impact\" category. Strangely, my sadness was immediately replaced by a sense of understanding. I saw them on stage and thought, \"Truly, their solution was the most deserving.\"</p>"},{"location":"my-stories-for-you/#act-iv-envy-as-fuel","title":"Act IV: Envy as Fuel","text":"<p>That defeat didn't feel like a defeat. I came home not with a trophy, but with a new perspective. The definition of \"extraordinary work\" in my mind had completely changed. It was no longer about complex algorithms or the latest technology, but about solutions that were truly human-oriented.</p> <p>I also realized that to build empathetic solutions, my technical foundation had to be solid. I couldn't truly help users if I wasn't a reliable developer myself.</p> <p>That encounter in Manila became a turning point. I began to map out my life goals anew, determined to master a field with a high degree of specific skill. The biggest decision born from that inspiration was to finally solidfy my plan for a Master's degree in Informatics, the path I am on today.</p> <p>To this day, I still follow J and her team's journey on social media. Every time I see their achievements, I\u2019ll be honest\u2014there's a little bit of envy. But it's no longer a toxic feeling. Instead, it has become the best kind of fuel, a constant reminder to keep chasing my own dreams, with a newfound definition of success.</p>"}]}
