Daliman</p> <p>Published: September 18, 2025</p> <p>Hi! I'm Dama D. Daliman, an undergrad student who's currently working on trying to make humans and AI get along, while also getting my feet wet into the world of backend development in blockchain with projects in cryptocurrency and Solana. My life is a constant exercise of managing real intelligence with \"fake\" intelligence.</p> <p>But this passion for making complex systems work together wasn't something that grew overnight (unlike the story of a certain disney princess wink). I had originally wanted to make super AI, because I watched one anime where it had super AI in it and it seemed really cool to have something like that. 2 years into college, all I did was mingle with data 24/7, trying to whack insights here and there. But nothing seemed to work out well. That is, until 2025 came along. I went through a gauntlet of hackathons. It was chaotic, sleepless months, that taught me more about developing code than any single class in college could ever.</p> <p>These past years of experience, from engineering data solutions to building backends, I've learned that I'm not just a developer. I'm a problem-solver who sees data as my buddy. My goal isn't just to write code, but to build systems that tell a clear, consistent, and reliable story.</p>"},{"location":"my-shapes/","title":"MY SHAPES","text":"<p>I\u2019ve always been driven by a deep curiosity and a love for understanding how things work. Today, I see myself as a passionate learner whose analytical mind thrives on complexity\u2014but not for complexity\u2019s sake. I\u2019m drawn to problems that demand both systems thinking and creativity, and I approach them with humility, knowing that the most elegant solutions often emerge from listening, iterating, and staying open to what I don\u2019t yet know.</p> <p></p> <p>This perspective didn\u2019t come overnight. Early in my journey, I immersed myself in data competitions, convinced that technical precision alone would chart my path forward. But over time, I realized that focusing too narrowly on metrics and models risked blinding me to the human dimensions of the challenges I wanted to solve. That shift\u2014learning to widen my lens\u2014was transformative. As an INTJ, I naturally lean into logic and structure, but my most important growth has come from embracing the limits of my own knowledge. The Chinese proverb \u201cabove the sky, there is still a sky\u201d resonates deeply with me: it reminds me that no matter how much I learn, there\u2019s always more beyond my horizon. That awareness has grounded me in humility and taught me to lead with empathy rather than judgment.</p> <p>Looking ahead, I\u2019m eager to bring this balanced mindset into a professional environment that values integrity, ethical reasoning, and collaborative innovation. I believe my ability to think abstractly, connect ideas across domains, and learn continuously\u2014paired with a genuine commitment to understanding people\u2014will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team. More than just solving problems, I want to help shape solutions that are thoughtful, inclusive, and enduring.</p>"},{"location":"my-shapes/#self-charter","title":"Self-Charter","text":"<p>Life Mission: To design and build ethical, systems-driven solutions that solve complex problems and foster peace, driven by a humble and continuous love of learning.</p> <p>Core Values: Ethics, Peace, Humility, Integrity, Financial Stability.</p> <p>Core Roles:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Systems-Thinker &amp; Problem-Solver: Leveraging abstract thinking and analytical reasoning to deconstruct complex challenges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creative &amp; Ethical Innovator: Applying creativity and cross-domain knowledge to build novel solutions with unwavering integrity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Empathetic Collaborator: Using empathy and collaborative intelligence to work effectively within a team and understand user needs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Decision Compass:</p> <ul> <li>Ethical Alignment: Does this align with my core values of ethics and integrity?</li> <li>Potential for Learning: Does this offer an opportunity to learn and grow, acknowledging there is always more to know?</li> <li>Making the Choice Right: Is this a path where I can commit to making my choice right, rather than searching for a perfect choice?</li> <li>Collaborative Peace: Does this foster a peaceful and collaborative environment?</li> </ul> <p>Service Promise: To approach challenges with humility , listen with empathy , offer well-reasoned analytical solutions , and innovate with creativity and integrity.</p> <p>Boundaries: Saying no to projects that compromise ethical principles.

No, it was the far more humble, almost clinical scent of industrial-strength air conditioning. That sterile aroma, a smell that promised both focus and anxiety, mingled with the constant, fascinating hum of a dozen different languages swirling together. It was a veritable Tower of Babel, but for code. Ten teams, different nations, all speaking the universal dialects of Python and JavaScript, yet all whispering their own unique hopes.</p> <p>Floating in that sea of ambition, I allowed myself to indulge in a heroic fantasy: I would be the one to carry the name of my nation, my university, onto that global stage. It was a beautiful, intoxicating thought. A thought that, as it turns out, was destined to be gloriously shattered in the most enlightening way possible.</p> <p>Of course, beneath all that bravado, the old familiar ghost of imposter syndrome had come along for the ride. Surrounded by the best of the best, a little voice that pays rent to live in the back of my mind began to whisper, \"Are you sure you belong here, kid?\"</p>"},{"location":"my-stories-for-you/#act-ii-of-dice-demeanor-and-a-grave-miscalculation","title":"Act II: Of Dice, Demeanor, and a Grave Miscalculation","text":"<p>Funnily enough, that nagging ghost was exorcised not by a sudden burst of self-confidence, but by the disarming friendliness of the other contestants. The place was practically overflowing with goodwill, especially from two certain teams from Korea. I found myself spending more time building bridges than agonizing over my own doubts. It was during this networking spree that I met \"J\" and her team.</p> <p>J carried herself with the quiet, unshakeable confidence of a chess master who is already five moves ahead of you. But what truly struck me was a wonderfully bizarre, humanizing detail: her apparent obsession with dice. She wore a necklace that spelled out \"clice\"\u2014a visual pun, perhaps, on the word \"dice.\" It was such a quirky, unexpected detail that, for a moment, I was more curious about her necklace than about the hackathon itself.</p> <p>Armed with this image of a cool, confident innovator, I was half-expecting a presentation style worthy of a rock concert. What I got, however, was a classic case of \"developer in the wild\"\u2014as socially effusive as a hibernating bear. When I saw their simple, straightforward demo, my first, unfiltered thought was, \"Wait, that's it?\" It was a profound miscalculation, a classic case of judging a book by its very, very quiet cover.</p>"},{"location":"my-stories-for-you/#act-iii-the-hotel-room-war","title":"Act III: The Hotel Room War","text":"<p>You see, the real contrast, the real drama, wasn't playing out under the bright lights of the exhibition hall. It was brewing in the dim, chaotic confines of our hotel room on the final night. The place had descended into what could only be described as a tech startup that had exploded inside a pizza box. Two of my teammates, running on fumes and pure panic, were determined to pull an all-nighter, a kamikaze run of coding that nearly made them miss breakfast.</p> <p>In the thick of this desperation, our team became a house divided. One member was dead-set on cramming in a flashy new AI feature. Another, bless his heart, proposed a strategy that landed with a thud in my gut: doing background checks on other teams to find weaknesses, to \"sabotage\" them. The idea felt less like strategy and more like sacrilege. It was a stark reminder that when the pressure is on, some people reach for a better tool, while others just reach for a bigger rock.</p> <p>I remember thinking how bizarre it was.

As they say, the bigger they are, the harder they fall, and my dream of waving that flag definitely took a tumble. There was that initial sting of disappointment, of course. But when I saw J's team ascend the stage to accept the \"Most Social Impact\" award, the sting was replaced by a resounding sense of clarity. It just felt\u2026 right.</p> <p>But the true lesson, the real trophy, wasn't handed out on that stage. It arrived quietly, a week later, in a WhatsApp message from J. I had asked her about her philosophy. Her answer was an observation, not a lecture: \"You know, whenever I see a great student CEO of a startup, I look them up on GitHub. I check their old repositories and find that so many of them started out as frontend developers.\"</p> <p>Reading that, it was like a key turning a lock I didn't even know existed in my mind.

A trophy is still a trophy, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want one. But what I learned in Manila is that sometimes, the consolation prize is worth infinitely more than the grand prize. The defeat gave me a gift I couldn't have won otherwise: perspective. It was my first real taste of the international stage, and it fundamentally changed my palate.</p> <p>I came home with a new creed. I learned that the shiniest tool in the box is just dead weight if you don't first understand the human heart it's meant to serve. And more often than not, the map to that heart can only be found when you dare to step off your own, well-trodden path and into the beautiful, chaotic, and eye-opening world of others. That, right there, was the real victory I brought home from Manila.</p>"}]}
