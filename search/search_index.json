Daliman</p> <p>Published: September 18, 2025</p> <p>Hi! I'm Dama D. Daliman, an undergrad student who's currently working on trying to make humans and AI get along, while also getting my feet wet into the world of backend development in blockchain with projects in cryptocurrency and Solana. My life is a constant exercise of managing real intelligence with \"fake\" intelligence.</p> <p>But this passion for making complex systems work together wasn't something that grew overnight (unlike the story of a certain disney princess wink). I had originally wanted to make super AI, because I watched one anime where it had super AI in it and it seemed really cool to have something like that. 2 years into college, all I did was mingle with data 24/7, trying to whack insights here and there. But nothing seemed to work out well. That is, until 2025 came along. I went through a gauntlet of hackathons. It was chaotic, sleepless months, that taught me more about developing code than any single class in college could ever.</p> <p>These past years of experience, from engineering data solutions to building backends, I've learned that I'm not just a developer. I'm a problem-solver who sees data as my buddy. My goal isn't just to write code, but to build systems that tell a clear, consistent, and reliable story.</p>"},{"location":"my-personal-reviews/","title":"Assessment Report for UTS-1 through UTS-5","text":""},{"location":"my-personal-reviews/#identification","title":"Identification","text":"<ul> <li>Student Name: Dama</li> <li>Student ID: 18222047</li> <li>Evaluator: Dama</li> </ul>"},{"location":"my-personal-reviews/#general-review","title":"General Review","text":"<p>The overall submission demonstrates a clear structure and logical organization across all tasks.

Anecdotes and examples are used to illustrate key points, which helps to capture the audience\u2019s attention. Humorous or light-hearted elements (where present) contribute positively without detracting from the message.</p> </li> <li> <p>Areas for Improvement: While the story is engaging, adding more vivid details or concrete examples could enhance originality and depth.

Some transitions between events are a bit abrupt, which can momentarily reduce the reader\u2019s immersion.

Today, I see myself as a passionate learner whose analytical mind thrives on complexity\u2014but not for complexity\u2019s sake. I\u2019m drawn to problems that demand both systems thinking and creativity, and I approach them with humility, knowing that the most elegant solutions often emerge from listening, iterating, and staying open to what I don\u2019t yet know.</p> <p>I\u2019ve come to see my approach to problem-solving much like my hobby in photography. My analytical mind is like a macro lens, allowing me to zoom in and understand the intricate, critical details of a challenge. But I know that true understanding requires more than just a close-up. That's why I value systems thinking\u2014it's like switching to a wide-angle lens to see the entire composition, understanding how every element connects and influences the whole. I\u2019m driven by a love for learning how to use both perspectives, approaching problems with the creativity of a photographer and the humility of knowing that the most elegant solution is the one that captures the complete picture.</p> <p></p> <p>This perspective didn\u2019t come overnight. Early in my journey, I immersed myself in data competitions, convinced that technical precision alone would chart my path forward. I vividly remember a competition called \"Data Slayers\" where my team was classifying vehicle types. My approach was generic, running through standard data cleaning techniques. Meanwhile, a teammate who carried our team to success was digging deeper, using domain knowledge to engineer features\u2014like how engine size correlates with fuel consumption for specific car models. It was a humbling moment. I realized that focusing too narrowly on models risked blinding me to the context that gives data meaning. That shift\u2014learning to widen my lens from the 'how' to the 'why'\u2014was transformative. As an INTJ, I naturally lean into logic and structure, but my most important growth has come from embracing the limits of my own knowledge. The proverb \u201cabove the sky, there is still a sky\u201d resonates deeply with me: it reminds me that no matter how much I learn, there\u2019s always more beyond my horizon. That awareness has grounded me in humility and taught me to lead with empathy rather than judgment.</p> <p>Looking ahead, I\u2019m eager to bring this balanced mindset into a professional environment that values integrity, ethical reasoning, and collaborative innovation. I believe my ability to think abstractly, connect ideas across domains, and learn continuously\u2014paired with a genuine commitment to understanding people\u2014will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team. More than just solving problems, I want to help shape solutions that are thoughtful, inclusive, and enduring.</p>"},{"location":"my-shapes/#self-charter","title":"Self-Charter","text":"<p>Life Mission: To design and build ethical, systems-driven solutions that solve complex problems and foster peace, driven by a humble and continuous love of learning.</p> <p>Core Values: Ethics, Peace, Humility, Integrity, Financial Stability.</p> <p>Core Roles:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Systems-Thinker &amp; Problem-Solver: Leveraging abstract thinking and analytical reasoning to deconstruct complex challenges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creative &amp; Ethical Innovator: Applying creativity and cross-domain knowledge to build novel solutions with unwavering integrity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Empathetic Collaborator: Using empathy and collaborative intelligence to work effectively within a team and understand user needs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Decision Compass:</p> <ul> <li>Ethical Alignment: Does this align with my core values of ethics and integrity?</li> <li>Potential for Learning: Does this offer an opportunity to learn and grow, acknowledging there is always more to know?</li> <li>Making the Choice Right: Is this a path where I can commit to making my choice right, rather than searching for a perfect choice?</li> <li>Collaborative Peace: Does this foster a peaceful and collaborative environment?</li> </ul> <p>Service Promise: To approach challenges with humility , listen with empathy , offer well-reasoned analytical solutions , and innovate with creativity and integrity.</p> <p>Boundaries: Saying no to projects that compromise ethical principles.
