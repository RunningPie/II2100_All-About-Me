Daliman</p> <p>Published: September 18, 2025</p> <p>Dama D. Daliman is an undergraduate student with a deep interest in database systems, data modeling, and backend development. Driven by a passion for building robust data solutions, they have explored career paths in Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering, and Data Architecture. This academic focus is complemented by hands-on experience, including developing a cryptocurrency backend system and actively participating in hackathons.</p> <p>Their technical skill set includes building applications with FastAPI, creating advanced visualizations in Power BI, and leveraging Docker and WSL for streamlined development environments. Beyond their core curriculum, they have independently researched MLOps concepts like CI/CD simplification and have engineered custom data streaming solutions for financial data.</p>"},{"location":"my-shapes/","title":"MY SHAPES","text":"<p>I\u2019ve always been driven by a deep curiosity and a love for understanding how things work. Today, I see myself as a passionate learner whose analytical mind thrives on complexity\u2014but not for complexity\u2019s sake. I\u2019m drawn to problems that demand both systems thinking and creativity, and I approach them with humility, knowing that the most elegant solutions often emerge from listening, iterating, and staying open to what I don\u2019t yet know.</p> <p></p> <p>This perspective didn\u2019t come overnight. Early in my journey, I immersed myself in data competitions, convinced that technical precision alone would chart my path forward. But over time, I realized that focusing too narrowly on metrics and models risked blinding me to the human dimensions of the challenges I wanted to solve. That shift\u2014learning to widen my lens\u2014was transformative. As an INTJ, I naturally lean into logic and structure, but my most important growth has come from embracing the limits of my own knowledge. The Chinese proverb \u201cabove the sky, there is still a sky\u201d resonates deeply with me: it reminds me that no matter how much I learn, there\u2019s always more beyond my horizon. That awareness has grounded me in humility and taught me to lead with empathy rather than judgment.</p> <p>Looking ahead, I\u2019m eager to bring this balanced mindset into a professional environment that values integrity, ethical reasoning, and collaborative innovation. I believe my ability to think abstractly, connect ideas across domains, and learn continuously\u2014paired with a genuine commitment to understanding people\u2014will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team. More than just solving problems, I want to help shape solutions that are thoughtful, inclusive, and enduring.</p>"}]}
